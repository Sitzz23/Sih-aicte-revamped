						The beginning of formal technical education in India can be dated
						back to the mid-19th century. Major policy initiatives in the
						pre-independence period included the appointment of the Indian
						Universities Commission in 1902, issue of the Indian Education
						Policy Resolution in 1904, and the Governor Generalâ€™s policy
						statement of 1913 stressing the importance of technical education,
						the establishment of IISc in Bangalore, Institute for Sugar, Textile
						& Leather Technology in Kanpur, N.C.E. in Bengal in 1905, and
						industrial schools in several provinces.
